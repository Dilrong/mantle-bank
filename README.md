## Who Uses It?

## Why Do They Use It?

They prefer a simple and intuitive user experience, favoring accessible banking over complexity.
There are negative perceptions around blockchain, such as scams, fraud, volatility, and technical complexity. However, by combining central bank-level reliability with an intuitive user experience, it reduces technical complexity and builds a more trustworthy image through reliable data.
Unlike traditional banks, it connects to cryptocurrency, enabling the pursuit of high returns and instilling pride in being tech-savvy.

We aim not to replace traditional banks but to redefine them based on transparent and secure data.
